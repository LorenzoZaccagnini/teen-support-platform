## Our vision
* The project is open source for maximum transparency
* We love Democracy, every member can exercise power by voting
* Everyone can improve this project, for example translate this project in your language if you want!
* Our support roles are voluntary
* Support roles are from remote and asynchronous, help other people WHEN you want and WHERE you want, you just need an internet connection
* We protect our users identity, we believe in anonymity

## We believe in
* Free sexual orientation
* Free Abortion, this is not the Republic of Gilead
* Single, multiple partners, the choice is yours 
* Genderless, be yourself without labels
* Everyone's frailties must be respected
* Asking for help requires courage
* Never blame the victim

## Privacy
* We guarantee the anonymity of our users, in order to signup we only ask for the age range and an email

## Roles
* Developers, build and manage the online platform
* Support, they are qualified members (student of psychology, psychologist, medic, etc...), they categorize and answer the questions 

## The online platform workflow
1. Someone anonymously post a question in the platform
2. A qualified member of our team (student of psychology, psychologist, medic, etc..) approve and categorize the question (anxiety, bullyism, addiction, etc..)
3. A qualified member of our team (student of psychology, psychologist, medic, etc..) choose a question from a pool of unanswered questions and gives a single answer, no chat.
4. The question is closed, other people can find the question and the answer publicly searching the platform
5. It is possible to upvote the question
